                <h2>The Tech­nology</h2>
                <p>Imagination, meet implementation. HTML5 is the cornerstone of the W3C's open web platform; a framework designed to support innovation and foster the full potential the web has to offer. Heralding this revolutionary collection of tools and standards, the HTML5 identity system provides the visual vocabulary to clearly classify and communicate our collective efforts.</p>

                <h2>The Movement</h2>
                <p>You're excited about HTML5; we are too. You've not just been enjoying the HTML5-powered web already — you're building it! As adoption and inspiration spreads, the web community will find creative ways to apply HTML5 and related technologies, spark trends, and capture best practices. As momentum builds, we hope you bring this logo along for the ride and paint the world orange.</p>

            <p>Please send a No. 10 business envelope to accommodate all three stickers, see below for more details and international shipping. Make sure to include enough postage to return a sticker pack via U.S. mail. It's less than one ounce, so a standard $0.44 stamp will do if you're in the United States.
