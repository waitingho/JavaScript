                    <img src=images/mobil.png />At last, the music industry admits what we've known for years: That filing music-swapping lawsuits against teenagers, little old ladies, and corpses is a fool's errand (not to mention an expensive headache for the defendants). But don't worryâ€”the RIAA has something new up its sleeves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new strategy (as reported by the Wall Street Journal): If the music industry finds out that you're swapping music files online, it'll send an e-mail to your ISP (agreements have already hashed out agreements with "some" unnamed service providers, apparently), which will in turn forward the message to youâ€”probably with a little "P.S." asking you to stop. [Update: CNET has a copy of the RIAA's form letter to ISPs.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you don't stop, well ... your service provider probably won't sue you, but it might slow down your broadband connection, or cut off your service altogether. 
                    So, why has the RIAA changed the play? Well, maybe it's been looking at reports like this one from the NPD Group, which shows that U.S. CD sales continue to slide, while the number of tunes shared via P2P sites continues to increase, despite all the litigation. 
                    And then there's the disastrous headlines, as the RIAA relentlessly tracked down and sued tens of thousands of alleged music pirates. Among them: Kids, octogenarians, and a few dead people.

                    Reaction to the news? Mixed. Engadget's headline reads (in part): "RIAA finds its soul," with the story noting that while the RIAA reserves the right to go after "heavy uploaders or repeat offenders ... it appears that single mothers are in the clear."
                    All Things Digital has a darker outlook, speculating that ISPsâ€”which "care about the cost of moving lots of data around â€¦ [and] want to make money by selling, renting, or just offering up Hollywood's movies and TV shows to subscribers"â€”might be more than content to "cut off file-sharers â€¦ [or] simply [charge] heavy file-sharers a lot of money."

                    All Things Digital has a darker outlook, speculating that ISPsâ€”which "care about the cost of moving lots of data around â€¦ [and] want to make money by selling, renting, or just offering up Hollywood's movies and TV shows to subscribers"â€”might be more than content to "cut off file-sharers â€¦ [or] simply [charge] heavy file-sharers a lot of money."

                    They finally start to make some sense. The giver pays, the receiver takes. You go after someone who shares, you don't go after someone who downloads. If someone is so generous to share, that someone pays for everything. Just like TV, you can watch the show for free because someone sponsored. They don't go after the watchers.
